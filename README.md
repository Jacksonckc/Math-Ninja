# Overview

Math Ninja is a simple Fruit-Ninja style game that provides a fun interface to practice math skills. Additionally, this application provides account functionaility to sync a user's profile and play history between devices.

To run a development instance of the application, you must first ensure all the proper packages are installed by running "npm install" with the current-working directing being the root of the project. After installation completion, you may start a local development server by running the following command: "npm run start".

You may also create a production server instead by running "npm run build".
